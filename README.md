# accesstokengenerator

IMPORTANT: Since the MCAuthLib from Geyser seems to be broken as of 2023, I wrote a quick replacement but without a fancy GUI:
https://github.com/LocutusV0nB0rg/npmAccessTokenGenerator

Simple GUI based generator for minecraft access tokens with Microsoft Authentication.

Based on the Authentication tool by Geyser https://github.com/GeyserMC/MCAuthLib/
